### Basic features
- Distinguishing a truck from other vehicles

- Identifying the model of a truck from a database

- Evaluating the speed of a truck

- The number of tires of the truck

- Identifying the load of the truck by evaluating the load/depression on their tires

### To more accurately speculate on the expected speed of a normally loaded truck:
- Identifying the rate of flow of traffic

- Identifying the curvature of the road

- Identifying the slope/elevation of the road

- Visually evaluating the physical condition of the road:
    - Pot holes
    - Slippery road


### Special scenarios/cases/parameters to account for:
- Evaluation of the parameters during low light situations
- Compensation for roads/curves around cliffs
